# DogDogBlog

A more clever name for a blog is probably out there, but this stuck in my head as goofy and fun. Which was the intent behind this project. I love animals and it made creating a fun little blog app all the more enjoyable.

Made primarily with NodeJS, express, ejs, body-parser, mongoose, mongoDB and Javascript

HTML & CSS on the front end for styling and Semantic UI as the styling framework.

    "body-parser": "^1.17.2",
    "ejs": "^2.5.6",
    "express": "^4.15.3",
    "express-sanitizer": "^1.0.2",
